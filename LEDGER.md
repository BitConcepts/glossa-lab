## [2026-06-07] Entry — Data Integrity Fixes + Kalyanaraman Integration + Phase Advancement + Dynamic Phases

Objective:
  Fix foundation check data integrity bugs, integrate Kalyanaraman rebus
  papers as second-source validation, fix phase advancement system, add
  dynamic phase generation.

What was done:

  1. ANCHOR TOTAL BUG FIX:
     - fa["total"] was set to H+M count only by 3 writer paths (promotion,
       auto-fix, cleanup script) but foundation check expected len(anchors)
     - Fixed in: api/research_loop.py, api/foundation_check.py, scripts/_fix_anchors.py
     - Repaired INDUS_FINAL_ANCHORS.json total: 260 → 286
     - Foundation check: 40 pass, 0 fail, 8 warn

  2. STALE DASHBOARD FIX:
     - "Next steps" showed stale fix_foundation proposal after FC was fixed
     - ResearchLoopPanel now filters out fix_foundation proposals when
       live FC shows 0 failures

  3. KALYANARAMAN REBUS INTEGRATION:
     - Built rebus lexicon from 52 PDFs: 24 rebus pairs, 200 Dravidian terms,
       144 sign references, 31 craft vocabulary items
     - Created KalyanCrossValidation atomic node + graph experiment
     - First run: 105 overlapping signs, 113 new candidates, complementarity=1.0
     - Auto-queued on every anchor promotion (alongside SA experiments)
     - Data file: backend/glossa_lab/data/kalyanaraman_rebus.json

  4. CGSA EXPERIMENT FIX:
     - ClusterMapper node referenced undefined `_log` instead of `logger`
     - One-line fix in experiment_graph.py

  5. SA MULTI-LANGUAGE BUILD FIX:
     - "nw semitic" split into ["nw", "semitic"] by whitespace regex
     - Added pre-normalization for multi-word language names before splitting

  6. PHASE ADVANCEMENT FIX:
     - Phase 5 was terminal — "Complete Phase" cleared state but coverage
       kept returning Phase 5. No Phase 6 existed.
     - Added completed_through_phase tracking in phase_state.json
     - Added Phase 6 (Peer Review) and Phase 7 (Publication)
     - _get_phase_for_coverage now skips completed phases
     - Verified: Phase 5 → 6 transition works via API

  7. DYNAMIC PHASE GENERATOR:
     - New module: pipelines/phase_generator.py
     - Auto-generates phase goals from available experiments + project state
     - Persists to outputs/phase_goals.json (editable)
     - API: GET /phase/goals, POST /phase/goals, POST /phase/generate
     - config.py loads dynamic goals when available, falls back to defaults

  8. STAGING REVIEW:
     - 14 staged candidates rejected (all from blocker_sign_context,
       recommended=false, statistically_sufficient=false, SA delta 4.9-5.0%)

Files changed:
  backend/glossa_lab/api/research_loop.py (promotion total fix + Kalyanaraman auto-queue)
  backend/glossa_lab/api/foundation_check.py (auto-fix total calculation)
  backend/glossa_lab/api/experiments.py (multi-word language normalization)
  backend/glossa_lab/api/phase.py (goals CRUD + generate endpoints)
  backend/glossa_lab/config.py (Phase 6+7, dynamic goal loading)
  backend/glossa_lab/experiment_graph.py (ClusterMapper _log fix, Kalyanaraman node registration)
  backend/glossa_lab/experiment_graph_kalyanaraman.py (NEW — cross-validation node)
  backend/glossa_lab/pipelines/phase_advancer.py (completed_through_phase tracking)
  backend/glossa_lab/pipelines/phase_generator.py (NEW — dynamic phase generation)
  backend/glossa_lab/data/kalyanaraman_rebus.json (NEW — rebus lexicon)
  backend/glossa_lab/experiments/graphs/indus_kalyanaraman_crossval.json (NEW)
  backend/scripts/_fix_anchors.py (total = len(anchors))
  backend/scripts/_build_kalyanaraman_lexicon.py (NEW — lexicon builder)
  backend/reports/INDUS_FINAL_ANCHORS.json (total repaired)
  frontend/src/components/ResearchLoopPanel.tsx (stale proposal filter)

Checks run:
  - Foundation check: 40 pass, 0 fail, 8 warn
  - Kalyanaraman cross-validation: COMPLEMENTARY (144 signs, 113 new candidates)
  - Phase advancement: Phase 5 → 6 verified via API
  - npm run build: clean, 0 TS errors
  - Backend health: healthy
  - specsmith audit: 29 pass, 2 issues (ledger TODOs + scaffold type)

Open TODOs:
  - [ ] Contact Suresh Kolichala via Academia.edu with review packet
  - [ ] Wait for Dravidianist responses (Renganathan, Murugaiyan, Kobayashi)
  - [ ] Check SSRN status (submission ID 6827038)

Next step:
  Run Phase 6 (Peer Review) experiments from the Phase Advancer UI.
